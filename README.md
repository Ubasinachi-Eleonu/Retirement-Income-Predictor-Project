# Retirement-Income-Predictor-Project
This project aims to predict the optimal monthly income a person can sustainably withdraw during retirement, ensuring it lasts a lifetime with a specified confidence level. Using personal, investment, and retirement data, the model identifies the maximum withdrawal amount that minimizes the risk of fund depletion.
